# World Happiness Report Analysis

This analysis explores the distribution of happiness across different countries based on various factors.

## A World Divided by Happiness

Our analysis of global happiness reveals a diverse landscape, with nations clustered across different levels of well-being.  We categorized countries into four groups based on their 'Sum Index,' a composite score derived from several key indicators.

**0-0.25:** 0 countries fall within this category, suggesting a similar level of happiness based on the combined indicators. 

**0.25-0.5:** 47 countries fall within this category, suggesting a similar level of happiness based on the combined indicators. 

**0.5-0.75:** 1699 countries fall within this category, suggesting a similar level of happiness based on the combined indicators. 

**0.75-1:** 617 countries fall within this category, suggesting a similar level of happiness based on the combined indicators. 

The 'Sum Index' represents a holistic measure, reflecting economic prosperity, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. Countries in the higher ranges of the index generally exhibit stronger performance across these dimensions. Those in the lower ranges may face more challenges in one or more of these areas, which consequently reflect on their overall happiness score.
